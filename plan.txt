Plan

functions:
 - is valid move
 - get hamitonian path
 - get next move with bfs



I can use BFS to get next move, but after getting the next move, I need to ensure a hamiltonian path exists. If it does, then I use the move.
If it does not, then I will keep dong BFS search. If i exaust BFS search, and no new moves have been found that maintain a hamiltonian path, then 
I default to the hamiltonian path.
